<details>
<summary>Lesson 1: The Rich Don’t Work for Money</summary>
<ul><li>This lesson places emphasis on the fact that the rich often veer from the ordinary route that most of us take in life: school, university and a good paying job at a reputable company. Kiyosaki notes that a regular job is just a short-term solution to the long-term challenge of creating wealth and financial freedom.</li>
<li>The consequences of taking this ordinary route is that most people become a slave to money. The fear of not having enough money to pay their bills is what keeps them in their jobs, and therefore trapped in a cycle of working more in order to earn enough and stay afloat.</li>

<ins>“The rich focus on their asset column, whilst everyone else focuses on their income statements.” </ins>

<summary>Lesson 4: The History of Taxes and the Power of Corporations</summary>
<p>This lesson opens with a brief history of taxes. Taxes initially came about to fund past wars in order for empires to fight for expansion, but in today’s world, they remain a regular part of society. Kiyosaki tells us that what sets the rich apart, is that they know how to manage their taxes. Here’s how:</p>
